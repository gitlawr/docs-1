Naturally, we implement the Harvester network based on CNI. Moreover, the Harvester UI integrates the Harvester network to provide a user-friendly way to configure networks for VMs. By version 0.2, Harvester supports two kinds of networks: management network VLAN Implementation \u00b6 Management Network \u00b6 Harvester adopts flannel as the default CNI to implement the management network. It's an internal network, which means the user can only access the VM's management network within its cluster nodes or pods. VLAN \u00b6 Harvester network-controller leverages the multus and bridge CNI plugins to implement the VLAN. Below is a use case of the VLAN in Harvester. Harvester network-controller uses a bridge for a node and a pair of veth for a VM to implement the VLAN. The bridge acts as a switch to forward the network traffic from or to VMs and the veth pair is like the connected ports between vms and switch. VMs within the same VLAN is able to communicate with each other, while the VMs within different VLANs can't. The external switch ports connected with the hosts or other devices(such as DHCP server) should be set as trunk or hybrid type and permit the specified VLANs. Users can use VLAN with PVID (default 1) to communicate with any normal untagged traffic. Enabling VLAN in the Harvester UI \u00b6 Enable VLAN via going to Setting > vlan to enable VLAN and input a valid default physical NIC name for the VLAN. The first physical NIC name of each Harvester node always defaults to eth0. It is recommended to choose a separate NIC for the VLAN other than the one used for the management network (the one selected during the Harvester installation) for better network performance and isolation. Note: Modifying the default VLAN network setting will not change the existing configured host networks. (optional) Users can always customize each node's VLAN network configuration via going to the HOST > Network tab. A new VLAN network is created by going to the Advanced > Networks page and clicking the Create button. The network is configured when the VM is created. Only the first network interface card will be enabled by default. Users can either choose to use a management network or VLAN network. Note: You will need to select the Install guest agent option in the Advanced Options tab to get the VLAN network IP address from the Harvester UI. Users can choose to add one or multiple network interface cards. Additional network interface card configurations can be set via cloud-init network data, e.g.: version : 1 config : - type : physical name : enp1s0 # name is varies upon OS image subnets : - type : dhcp - type : physical name : enp2s0 subnets : - type : DHCP","title":"Harvester Network"},{"location":"harvester-network/#harvester-network","text":"Harvester is built on Kubernetes, which uses CNI as an interface between network providers and Kubernetes pod networking.

Please do not make the configuration file publicly accessible at the moment. server_url \u00b6 The URL of the Harvester server to join as an agent. This configuration is mandatory when the installation is in JOIN mode. It tells the Harvester installer where the main server is. Example server_url : https://someserver:6443 install : mode : join token \u00b6 The cluster secret or node token. If the value matches the format of a node token it will automatically be assumed to be a node token. Otherwise it is treated as a cluster secret. In order for a new node to join the Harvester cluster, the token should match from what server has.

By default there is no password for the rancher user. If you set a password at runtime it will be reset on next boot. The value of the password can be clear text or an encrypted form. The easiest way to get this encrypted form is to just change your password on a Linux system and copy the value of the second field from /etc/shadow . You can also encrypt a password using openssl passwd -1 . Example os : password : \"$1$tYtghCfK$QHa51MS6MVAcfUKuOzNKt0\" Or clear text os : password : supersecure os.environment \u00b6 Environment variables to be set on k3s and other processes like the boot process.

If NIC cards don't come with iPXE firmware, iPXE firmware images can be loaded from the TFTP server first. To see sample iPXE scripts, please visit https://github.com/harvester/ipxe-examples. Preparing HTTP Servers \u00b6 An HTTP server is required to serve boot files. Please ensure these servers are set up correctly before continuing. Let's assume an NGINX HTTP server's IP is 10.100.0.10 , and it serves /usr/share/nginx/html/ folder at the path http://10.100.0.10/ .

TROUBLESHOOTING Sometimes the installer might be not able to fetch the Harvester configuration file because the network stack is not ready yet. To work around this, please add a boot_cmd parameter to the iPXE script, e.g., #!ipxe kernel vmlinuz k3os.mode=install console=ttyS0 console=tty1 harvester.install.automatic=true harvester.install.config_url=http://10.100.0.10/harvester/config-join.yaml boot_cmd=\"echo include_ping_test=yes >> /etc/conf.d/net-online\" initrd initrd boot DHCP server configuration \u00b6 Here is an example to configure the ISC DHCP server to offer iPXE scripts: option architecture-type code 93 = unsigned integer 16 ; subnet 10 .100.0.0 netmask 255 .255.255.0 { option routers 10 .100.0.10 ; option domain-name-servers 192 .168.2.1 ; range 10 .100.0.100 10 .100.0.253 ; } group { # create group if exists user-class and option user-class = \"iPXE\" { # iPXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-create-efi\" ; } else { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-create\" ; } } else { # PXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { # UEFI filename \"ipxe.efi\" ; } else { # Non-UEFI filename \"undionly.kpxe\" ; } } host node1 { hardware ethernet 52 :54:00:6b:13:e2 ; } } group { # join group if exists user-class and option user-class = \"iPXE\" { # iPXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-join-efi\" ; } else { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-join\" ; } } else { # PXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { # UEFI filename \"ipxe.efi\" ; } else { # Non-UEFI filename \"undionly.kpxe\" ; } } host node2 { hardware ethernet 52 :54:00:69:d5:92 ; } } The config file declares a subnet and two groups. The first group is for hosts to boot with CREATE mode and the other one is for JOIN mode. By default, the iPXE path is chosen, but if it sees a PXE client, it also offers the iPXE image according to client architecture. Please prepare those images and a tftp server first. Harvester configuration \u00b6 For more information about Harvester configuration, please refer to the Harvester configuration . Users can also provide configuration via kernel parameters. For example, to specify the CREATE install mode, the user can pass the harvester.install.mode=create kernel parameter when booting. Values passed through kernel parameters have higher priority than values specified in the config file. UEFI HTTP Boot support \u00b6 UEFI firmware supports loading a boot image from HTTP server. This section demonstrates how to use UEFI HTTP boot to load the iPXE program and perform the automatic installation. Serve the iPXE program \u00b6 Download the iPXE uefi program from http://boot.ipxe.org/ipxe.efi and make ipxe.efi can be downloaded from the HTTP server. e.g.: cd /usr/share/nginx/html/harvester/ wget http://boot.ipxe.org/ipxe.efi The file now can be downloaded from http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe.efi DHCP server configuration \u00b6 If the user plans to use the UEFI HTTP boot feature by getting a dynamic IP first, the DHCP server needs to provides the iPXE program URL when it sees such a request. Here is an updated ISC DHCP server group example: group { # create group if exists user-class and option user-class = \"iPXE\" { # iPXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-create-efi\" ; } else { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-create\" ; } } elsif substring ( option vendor-class-identifier, 0 , 10 ) = \"HTTPClient\" { # UEFI HTTP Boot option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\" ; filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe.efi\" ; } else { # PXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { # UEFI filename \"ipxe.efi\" ; } else { # Non-UEFI filename \"undionly.kpxe\" ; } } host node1 { hardware ethernet 52 :54:00:6b:13:e2 ; } } The elsif substring statement is new, and it offers http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe.efi when it sees a UEFI HTTP boot DHCP request. After the client fetches the iPXE program and runs it, the iPXE program will send a DHCP request again and load the iPXE script from URL http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-create-efi . The iPXE script for UEFI boot \u00b6 It's mandatory to specify the initrd image for UEFI boot in the kernel parameters. Here is an updated version of iPXE script for CREATE mode. #!ipxe kernel vmlinuz initrd=initrd k3os.mode=install console=ttyS0 console=tty1 harvester.install.automatic=true harvester.install.config_url=http://10.100.0.10/harvester/config-create.yaml initrd initrd boot The parameter initrd=initrd is required for initrd to be chrooted.","title":"PXE Boot Install"},{"location":"install/pxe-boot-install/#pxe-boot-install","text":"Starting from version 0.2.0 , Harvester can be installed in a mass manner.

To work around this, please add a boot_cmd parameter to the iPXE script, e.g., #!ipxe kernel vmlinuz k3os.mode=install console=ttyS0 console=tty1 harvester.install.automatic=true harvester.install.config_url=http://10.100.0.10/harvester/config-join.yaml boot_cmd=\"echo include_ping_test=yes >> /etc/conf.d/net-online\" initrd initrd boot","title":"JOIN mode"},{"location":"install/pxe-boot-install/#dhcp-server-configuration","text":"Here is an example to configure the ISC DHCP server to offer iPXE scripts: option architecture-type code 93 = unsigned integer 16 ; subnet 10 .100.0.0 netmask 255 .255.255.0 { option routers 10 .100.0.10 ; option domain-name-servers 192 .168.2.1 ; range 10 .100.0.100 10 .100.0.253 ; } group { # create group if exists user-class and option user-class = \"iPXE\" { # iPXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-create-efi\" ; } else { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-create\" ; } } else { # PXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { # UEFI filename \"ipxe.efi\" ; } else { # Non-UEFI filename \"undionly.kpxe\" ; } } host node1 { hardware ethernet 52 :54:00:6b:13:e2 ; } } group { # join group if exists user-class and option user-class = \"iPXE\" { # iPXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-join-efi\" ; } else { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-join\" ; } } else { # PXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { # UEFI filename \"ipxe.efi\" ; } else { # Non-UEFI filename \"undionly.kpxe\" ; } } host node2 { hardware ethernet 52 :54:00:69:d5:92 ; } } The config file declares a subnet and two groups.
